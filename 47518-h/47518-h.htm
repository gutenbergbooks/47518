he lies?</p>

<div class="i0">Now my charms are all o'erthrown,</div>
<div class="i0">And what strength I have's mine own,</div>
<div class="i0">Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,</div>
<div class="i0">I must be here confined by you,</div>
<div class="i0">Or sent to Naples. Let me not,</div>
<div class="i0">Since I have my dukedom got</div>
<div class="i0">And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell</div>
<div class="i0">In this bare island by your spell;</div>
<div class="i0">But release me from my bands</div>
<div class="i0">With the help of your good hands:</div>
<div class="i0">Gentle breath of yours my sails</div>
<div class="i0">Must fill, or else my project fails,</div>
<div class="i0">Which was to please. Now I want</div>
<div class="i0">Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,</div>
<div class="i0">And my ending is despair,</div>
<div class="i0">Unless I be relieved by prayer,</div>
<div class="i0">Which pierces so that it assaults</div>
<div class="i0">Mercy itself and frees all faults.</div>
<div class="i0">As you from crimes would pardon'd be,</div>
<div class="i0">Let your indulgence set me free.</div>
